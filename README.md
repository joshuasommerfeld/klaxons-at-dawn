# Klaxons at Dawn

A game about an unlikely group of strangers surviving the start of the zombie apocalypse trapped on a runaway transport.

Klaxons at Dawn aims to invoke the feeling of the zombie movie Train to Busan.

# Gameplay

## What you need

- Pencils
- Paper
- A bunch of six-sided dice
- 4 - 6 players
  - 1 player will act as the "director"

## Goal

Take the transport to the utopian destination, and don't die to zombies!

This game is built around the scenario that the player characters are on the same type of transport when the zombie outbreak begins. 
This motley group of strangers will need to band together to protect this transport, keep it moving, and get to the utopian destination.

### Transport

Choose 1 of the following transports (or choose randomly):
1. Metro train
2. Rural train
3. Cruise ship
4. Ferry
5. Large passenger plane
6. Space ship

### Utopian destination

The group should decide on a name for the destination. This place has the outbreak under control and is accepting refugees. It is the goal of all players to get there.

## Scenes

Players should be seated in a circle. 
Progressing clockwise, the players take turns describing a scene setup that involves their character. 
This scene is then played out among the players, though not all PCs need to be involved in all scenes. 

The best scenes display the strengths or weaknesses of the active player character through the lens of the evolving predicaments facing the survivors.
They should be short and snappy, ideally no more than 5 minutes.

Each players first scene should describe a facet of their normal lives and explain how they found themselves on the transport that day.

The Director goes last in scene order. 
When it's the directors turn, they describe a scene that escalates tensions with the zombie outbreak or the survivors and adds 1 to the relevant tension meter.
The first director scene of the game should ALWAYS add 1 to the zombie tension meter.

## Escalations

As the game progresses, PCs will fail. When this happens, tensions rise. 
These are represented by tension meters, and when they overflow, an escalation event occurs.
The game ends after the 5th escalation, triggering the final escalation.
If the PCs made it to the utopian destination at the end of this, they did it!

## Gear

PCs may use their scenes in order to obtain an item that will assist them throughout the game.
Gear can be obtained on the active PCs turn (may require a check).

Gear:
 - Allows the PC to change the number on a single die by 1 during a check where the item would be relevant.
 - Can also be sacrificed in order to add a single success to a check.

Gear is also useful during the final escalation, in that it can help your character survive.

## Checks

If something would be non-trivial, then the player character needs to roll the dice. 
This could be for anything, like killing zombies, obtaining helpful gear, convincing people, tricking people etc.

When a character makes a check, they:
- Roll 1 six sided die
- Roll an additional die if it is related to your personality or aptitude
- Roll an additional die if you are prepared / supported by another PC

Roll the dice and count your successes:
- 0 - Failure. Add 1 to a tension meter
- 1 - Mixed success. You do what you want but it also adds 1 to a tension meter.
- 2 - Success. You do what you want with no downside.
- 3 - Critical success. You do what you want super well. This gives an additional benefit, or can reduce a tension meter by 1.

### Success and Ratings
Each character has two ratings: Personality and Aptitude. Successes are determined by the following:

### Personality
#### Truthful, charming, convincing
When a player is honest and aiming to be convincing, charismatic, or show leadership they need to roll their Personality rating or under
#### Sneaking, deceiving, 
When a player is aiming to trick or do something underhanded, they need to roll their Personality rating or above

### Aptitude
#### Fighting, running, leaping
When a player is trying to kick some ass, or pull off something that is physically taxing, they need to roll their Aptitude rating or under
#### Planning, thinking, fixing
When a player is trying to create something, prove their knowledge, plan and support others, they need to roll their Aptitude rating or above

# Tension Meters

There are 2 tension meters:
* Survivor: Representing the rising angst and fear among the PC or NPC survivors, or even in the general world.
* Zombie: Representing the increasing power of the zombies as more people are turned in these opening days of the apocalypse.

Each meter starts at 0

Whenever a player fails a check, add 1 to either the survivor or zombie tension meter (GM should choose which they feel is more appropriate).

Whenever a tension meter reaches the number of players, an escalation happens. 
Escalations add new elements, obstacles and challenges into the story.

When an escalation happens, the GM should mark it down and then roll on the associated table. 
If it's the fifth escalation, instead trigger The Final Escalation.

## Zombie Escalations

1. The zombies make their way into the engine room, breaking it and stopping the transport until it is fixed.
2. Zombies break in to where the survivors are currently, or into a previously safe area.
3. A mutant mega zombie is introduced (can be in it's own scene and revealed to the player characters later)
4. Zombies are now fast and can work together
5. One of the survivor PCs or NPCs has been hiding a bite; they turn into a zombie suddenly and violently
6. A PC is killed by a zombie

## Human Escalations

1. Something happens that splits the party into two. GM chooses who gets paired.
2. Surivior party runs into another group of survivors, but they are hostile.
3. The vehicle blows up and the survivors will have to find an alternative transport.
4. A military operations unit shows up, purging zombies and survivors alike.
5. A player character has an epiphany which causes a personality shift (they move their personality rating up or down 1)
6. A player character is killed by a human survivor

# The Final Escalation

Things are getting serious. This is it. From here on out, any failures on checks by PCs will result in them being killed **UNLESS**
1. They have a piece of gear they can sacrifice.
2. Another player sacrifices themselves for them. 

Once the final escalation occurs, each player is allowed two scenes. 
All PCs should either have made it to the destination or have died by this time.

# Character Creation

Roll 2 dice per player, adding them into a central pool of dice.

Players take turns picking dice from this central pool. Once this is over, each player should have a Personality and an Aptitude. 

All 1 dice can be used as wild on the Personality table. All 6 dice can be used as wild on the Aptitude table. The last dice is always a wild.

eg. A player could take a 2 from the pool and proclaim they are either a Surivalist or a Support. The next die they take would then represent the other rating.

# Characters

## Personality

### Miscreant
Your motivation is simple: Take care of number one. You carved out a dark little nook in "polite" society. You lied, you connived,  you fucked over everyone around you just to get by. They would have done the same to you. Now that the world has turned upside down, you see an opportunity: to finally come out on top.

**Advantage**: When you're lying to people, being underhanded.

**Special**: One time, you can steal any piece of gear off another player without them (immediately) knowing.

### Survivalist
You were prepared for this. Whether you wanted it to happen, or whether it kept you up at night, you've got everything you need in that head of yours. Surround yourself with people that are useful, and the rest...well they aren't going to make it anyway. Just follow your rules, and don't do anything stupid.

**Advantage**: When being pragmatic, knowing things.

**Special**: One time, you have "just the right thing for the job" and gain exactly the piece of gear you want.

### Average Joe
How did you even get in this situation? Work, TV, friends, you liked your simple life. Now people seem to disregard you and your opinions. Secretly though you are the beating heart of this rag tag ensemble, you're the glue that sticks them together. Whether it's tempering the passionate but misguided opinions of the paragon, or getting the paranoid Survivalist on side, you'll pull through when they really need you. You're not too sure about the Miscreant though...

**Advantage**: When you're calming people down, bringing people together.
**Special**: One time, you can force a critical success instead of rolling.

### Paragon
You have an iron will and a vision. You will do anything to protect those around you, friend or enemy. You can save everyone, and you demand success from this dark world. Your unshakable belief will lead to safety, or maybe salvation. You know what's best for them, even if they don't agree sometimes.

**Advantage**: When convincing people to do the "right" thing.

**Special**: One time, you can "create" an NPC with just the right set of skills.

## Aptitude

### Mastermind
You can see what that others can't. The ties and tensions between people, the forces that are governing your society. You've succeeded by planning ahead. While the rules of the world have changed, you have not. You learn fast.

**Advantage**: When hatching a plan.

**Special**: One time, you can 

### Support
You have dedicated your life to helping others. You've seen what happens when people take what they need and give nothing back. Now more than ever you know that being there for those around you is the only chance you all have at surviving.

**Advantage**: When helping another.

**Special**: One time, you can help another player by giving them a critical success instead of them rolling.

### Wildcard
You're a go getter. You get things done when no one else could. Some say you're too extreme. Some say you're bat shit insane. But you come out on top when no one expects it. Physically you're not much to look at, but you've got more in the tank than people think. So let them underestimate you. That's how you like it.

**Advantage**: When doing something so crazy, it just might work.

**Special**: 

### Warrior
Maybe you had the fight in you all along. Maybe the Klaxxons awakened something in you that slept, dormant just under the surface. Either way, you were born for a violent world. You are a primal force to be reckoned with, and nothing is standing between you, your loves ones, and survival.

**Advantage**: Beating the ever loving crap out of something.

**Special**: You cannot be killed by zombies, unless you willingly sacrifice yourself for another.
