# Klaxons at Dawn

A game about a group of strangers banding together to survive the start of the zombie apocalypse while trapped on a runaway transport.

Klaxons at Dawn is a role playing game which aims to evoke the zombie movie Train to Busan. All players have equal input into the collaborative creation of the story, with most players taking the role of survivors, and 1 player taking the role of the zombie threat.

# Gameplay

## What you need

- Pencils
- Paper
- A bunch of six-sided dice
- 4 - 6 players
  - 1 player will act as the "director".
  - The rest of the players will be a player character (PC).

## Goal

Take the transport to the utopian destination, and don't get eaten by zombies!

Klaxons at Dawn is built around the scenario that the player characters are on the same type of transport when the zombie outbreak begins. 
This group of strangers will need to band together to protect the transport, keep it moving, and get to the utopian destination before the zombies.

## Core Concept Glossary

- **Player**: A member of the playgroup, including the director.
- **Character** or **PC**: A character which a player is role playing as.
- **Director**: The player who is setting up obstacles and challenges for the PCs to overcome.
- **Non-player character (NPC)**: A survivor character not related to any player.
- **Scene**: Players will take turns setting up scenes, which the players will then role play out.
- **Active player / Active character**: The player who set the current scene up.
- **Check**: A player will have to roll dice in order to determine whether their character succeeds or fails at non-trivial tasks.
- **Gear**: Characters may find gear during the story they can use to help them survive.
- **Tension Meters**: When a character fails at a task, tension meters will grow. When they overflow, an escalation occurs.
- **Escalation**: An event that adds new elements and obstacles into the story. There are 5 in a game of Klaxons at Dawn, with the last one being the *final escalation*
- **Final Escalation**: The last scenes as tension reach a fever pitch. This leads to the final moments of the story.

### Transport

Choose 1 of the following transports (or choose randomly):
1. Metro train
2. Rural train
3. Cruise ship
4. Ferry
5. Large passenger plane
6. Space ship

### Setting

The group should decide on the backdrop for the story. Some potential questions for the group:
- Is it modern day? The past? The future?
- Do the players start in a sparsely populated region? Or a city? 
- Where are they going? Away from the threat? Towards a safe haven within a zombie hotspot?

I like asking each member of the group to contribute a facet of the setting with a simple 1 or 2 word phrase!

### Utopian destination

The group should decide on a name for the destination. This place has the outbreak under control and is accepting refugees. It is the goal of all players to get there.

## Scenes

As the game begins, players should take turns setting up a scene that describes a facet of their normal lives, and explains how they found themselves on the transport that day.
As one player ends their scene, another character starts theirs.
The Director should note the order, as this decides the scene order that people will take moving forward.

Progressing through this order, the players continue to take turns describing a scene setup that involves their character. 
This scene is then played out among the players, though not all PCs need to be involved in all scenes. 

The best scenes display the strengths or weaknesses of the active player character through the lens of the evolving predicaments facing the survivors.
They should be short and snappy, ideally no more than 5 minutes.

After the first round of scenes, we recommend every scene be framed around a check that the active player will make. 
The check can be made up front, and then the players role play towards that outcome, or you can wait to make the check.
This helps if players aren't sure where to go next, make them think about what their player is good at and ask them what that can contribute.

The director goes last in scene order. 
When it's the directors turn, they describe a scene that escalates tensions with the zombie outbreak or the survivors and adds 1 to the relevant tension meter.
The first director scene of the game should ALWAYS add 1 to the zombie tension meter.

Whenever an escalation occurs, reset the scene order.
We reccommend that all players begin standing up, and when they begin their scene they sit down. This ensures the order is clockwise which makes things easy, and gets people moving.

## The Survivors

Each scene should be treated as a "Yes and" scene to the previous scenes. I do not recommend scenes undoing the work of previous player characters.

In addition to this, no scene should split the party up for an extended period of time, unless an effect calls for it such as an escalation or character special move.

The active player in a scene has the last word per decisions within their scene, though we encourage all players engage in a discussion on what would be the most fun.
Remember the goal is to make a great story, not to be the last character standing!

## Escalations

As the game progresses, PCs will roll dice to see if their player character succeeds or fails at certain activities. 
When they fail, things get worse for the survivors. 
This is represented by **Tension Meters**, and when they overflow, an escalation event occurs.
The game ends after the 4th escalation, triggering the final escalation.
If the PCs made it to the utopian destination at the end of this, they did it!

## Gear

PCs may use their scenes in order to obtain an item that will assist them throughout the game.
Gear can be obtained on the active PCs turn (may require a check).

Gear:
 - Allows the PC to change the number on a single die by 1 during a check where the item would be relevant.
 - Can also be sacrificed in order to add a single success to a check.

Gear is also useful during the final escalation, in that it can help your character survive.

## Checks

If something would be non-trivial for any character to achieve, then the active player needs to roll the dice to determine whether their character succeeds or fails.
This could be for anything, like killing zombies, obtaining helpful gear, convincing people, tricking people etc.

When a character makes a check, they:
- Roll 1 six sided die
- Roll an additional die if it is related to your personality or aptitude
- Roll an additional die if you are prepared / supported by another PC

Roll the dice and count your successes:
- 0 - Failure. Add 1 to a tension meter
- 1 - Mixed success. You do what you want but it also adds 1 to a tension meter.
- 2 - Success. You do what you want with no downside.
- 3 - Critical success. You do what you want super well. This gives an additional benefit, or can reduce a tension meter by 

### Success and Ratings
Each character has two ratings: Personality and Aptitude. Successes are determined by the following:

### Personality (For dealing with other peple)
#### If a character is leading, charming, being honest
When a player is honest and aiming to be convincing, charismatic, or show leadership they need to roll their Personality rating or under
#### If a character is deceiving, Sneaking, subverting
When a player is aiming to trick or do something underhanded, they need to roll their Personality rating or above

### Aptitude (For dealing with zombies and survival)
#### If a character is fighting, running, leaping
When a player is trying to kick some ass, or pull off something that is physically taxing, they need to roll their Aptitude rating or under
#### If a character is planning, building, fixing
When a player is trying to create something, prove their knowledge, plan and support others, they need to roll their Aptitude rating or above

### Inter PC Checks
This is a game where the characters may not see eye to eye, and some may be in conflict at the core of their personalities.
Characters will also naturally be able to express power over other characters, such as a Paragon or Miscreant.
This can create player tension.
All players should remember they are writers for their character, not the character themselves.

While a player character can roll a check to express their intent over another player character, this should be done with the consent of the player who's character this will effect.
Even if this check is successful, the victim of this coercion may choose to instead reject this intent and instead add 1 to the survivor tension meter.
This is to make sure there is a pressure valve for tension between players, though ideally it should not be necessary.
Each of you have the final say in your characters choices, but remember that bad choices can create a much more fun story!

# Tension Meters

There are 2 tension meters:
* **Survivor**: Representing the rising angst and fear among the PC or NPC survivors, or even in the general world.
* **Zombie**: Representing the increasing power of the zombies as more people are turned in these opening days of the apocalypse.

Each meter starts at 0

Whenever a player fails a check, add 1 to either the survivor or zombie tension meter (Director should choose which they feel is more appropriate).

Whenever a tension meter reaches 4, an escalation happens. 
Escalations add new elements, obstacles and challenges into the story.

When an escalation happens, the Director should mark it down and then roll on the associated table. 
If it's the 4th escalation, instead trigger The Final Escalation.

## Zombie Escalations

1. The zombies make their way into the engine room, breaking it and stopping the transport until it is fixed.
2. Zombies break in to where the survivors are currently, or into a previously safe area.
3. A mutant mega zombie is introduced (can be in it's own scene and revealed to the player characters later)
4. Zombies are now fast and can work together
5. One of the survivor PCs or NPCs has been hiding a bite; they turn into a zombie suddenly and violently
6. A PC is killed by a zombie. They create a new character that is introduced in that players' next scene.

## Human Escalations

1. Something happens that splits the party into two. The Director chooses who gets paired.
2. The party runs into another group of survivors, but they are hostile.
3. The vehicle blows up and the survivors will have to find an alternative transport.
4. A military operations unit shows up, purging zombies and survivors alike.
5. A player character has an epiphany which causes a personality shift (they move their personality rating up or down 1)
6. A PC is killed by another PC or NPC. They create a new character that is introduced in that players' next scene.

# The Final Escalation

Things are getting serious. This is it. From here on out, any failures on checks by PCs will result in them being killed **UNLESS**
1. They have a piece of gear they can sacrifice.
2. Another player sacrifices themselves for them. 

Once the final escalation occurs, each player is allowed two scenes. 
All PCs should either have made it to the destination or have died by this time.

# Character Creation

Roll 2 dice per player, adding them into a central pool of dice.

Players take turns picking dice from this central pool. Once this is over, each player should have a Personality and an Aptitude. 

All 1 dice can be used as wild on the Personality table. All 6 dice can be used as wild on the Aptitude table. The last dice is always a wild.

eg. A player could take a 2 from the pool and proclaim they are either a Wildcard in Personality or a Support in Aptitude. The next die they take would then represent the other rating.

## Personality

2. Miscreant
3. Wildcard
4. Average Joe
5. Paragon

## Aptitude

2. Mastermind
3. Support
4. Survivalist
5. Warrior

# Characters

## Personality

### 2 Miscreant
Your motivation is simple: Take care of number one. You carved out a dark little nook in "polite" society. You lied, you connived,  you fucked over everyone around you just to get by. They would have done the same to you. Now that the world has turned upside down, you see an opportunity: to finally come out on top.

**Advantage**: When you're lying to people, being underhanded.

**Special Move**: _Split the Party_: One time, you can give the players an alternative to a decision made by the active character or Paragon. All other players can choose to go with you, or stay with the active player or Paragon.

### 3 Wildcard
You're a go getter. You get things done when no one else could. Some say you're too extreme. Some say you're bat shit insane. But you come out on top when no one expects it. Physically you're not much to look at, but you've got more in the tank than people think. So let them underestimate you. That's how you like it.

**Advantage**: When doing something so crazy, it just might work.

**Special Move**: _Reckless_: Any time, you can add 1 to the zombie tension meter in order to add 1 success to a check.

### 4 Average Joe
How did you even get in this situation? Work, TV, friends, you liked your simple life. Now people seem to disregard you and your opinions. Secretly though you are the beating heart of this rag tag ensemble, you're the glue that sticks them together. Whether it's tempering the passionate but misguided opinions of the paragon, or getting the paranoid Survivalist on side, you'll pull through when they really need you. You're not too sure about the Miscreant though...

**Advantage**: When you're calming people down, bringing people together.

**Special Move**: _Coming through_: One time, you can get an automatic critical success on a check instead of rolling.

### 5 Paragon
You have an iron will and a vision. You will do anything to protect those around you, friend or enemy. You can save everyone, and you demand success from this dark world. Your unshakable belief will lead to safety, or maybe salvation. You know what's best for them, even if they don't agree sometimes.

**Advantage**: When convincing people to do the "right" thing.

**Special Move**: _You know best_: Any time, you can add 1 to the survivor tension meter to get your way on a survivor group decision.

**SPECIAL NOTE**: The Paragon special move is incredibly powerful and easily abused. We suggest that the Paragon player not use this ability because they, as a player, wish for a different outcome to a decision, but instead that they believe their *character* would wish for a different decision. This move is to be used judiciously...but it can make great tension between characters.

## Aptitude

### 2 Mastermind
You can see what that others can't. The ties and tensions between people, the forces that are governing your society. You've succeeded by planning ahead. While the rules of the world have changed, you have not. You learn fast.

**Advantage**: When hatching a plan.

**Special Move**: _Of course!_: One time, you can 'discover' a weakness that all the zombies suffer from (Mastermind gets to make it up)

### 3 Support
You have dedicated your life to helping others. You've seen what happens when people take what they need and give nothing back. Now more than ever you know that being there for those around you is the only chance you all have at surviving.

**Advantage**: When helping another.

**Special Move**: _Helping hand_: One time, you can help another player by giving them a critical success instead of them rolling.

### 4 Survivalist
You were prepared for this. Whether you wanted it to happen, or whether it kept you up at night, you've got everything you need in that head of yours. Surround yourself with people that are useful, and the rest...well they aren't going to make it anyway. Just follow your rules, and don't do anything stupid.

**Advantage**: When being pragmatic, knowing things.

**Special Move**: _Prepared_: One time, you have "just the right thing for the job" and gain exactly the piece of gear you want.

### 5 Warrior
Maybe you had the fight in you all along. Maybe the Klaxons awakened something in you that slept, dormant just under the surface. Either way, you were born for a violent world. You are a primal force to be reckoned with, and nothing is standing between you, your loves ones, and survival.

**Advantage**: Beating the ever loving crap out of something.

**Special Move**: _Unbreakable_: You cannot be killed by zombies, unless you willingly sacrifice yourself for another.
